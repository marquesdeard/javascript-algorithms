# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Notes

## Asymptotic Notations

- Time Complexity : Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size
- Space Complexity : Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run , as a function of input size

## Asymptotic Notations

- Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
- Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity
- Theta Notation (θ-notation) - Avarage case complexity

### Big-O Notation

The worst case complexity of an algorithm is representing using the Big-O Notation
Big-O Notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

It Has two important characteristics

- It is expressed in terms of the input
- It focused on the bigger picture withour getting cought up in the minute details

### Space Complexity

- O(1) - Constant
- O(n) - Linear
- O(logn) - Logarithmic
